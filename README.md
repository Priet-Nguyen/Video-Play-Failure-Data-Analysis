# Video-Play-Failure-Data-Analysis
Data analysis on dataset Video Play Failure, which was recorded to be increased in the second half of a major champions league football game, that was exclusively on Sky Germany.

In this comprehensive analysis of the Video Play Failure (VPF) data, I addressed key questions to provide valuable insights. The impact assessment revealed that the VPF influenced 38733 users, 29 countries and 181 states; among them there are 95% of the users from Germany and 56,8% users come from 3 States: Nordrhein-westfalen, Bremen and Bayern. Moreover there is a correlation between the number of interrupts and their durations, with 44% of issues showing no interrupts and durations less than one minute. Finally, a detailed breakdown based on specific devices, operating systems, and players allowed one to pinpoint the root causes of the issues. These findings are pivotal in guiding further investigations and formulating targeted solutions to enhance the streaming experience for the users.
